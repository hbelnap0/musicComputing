Phase = starting point of the initial cycle of waveform
Amplitude = loudness of the signal, too high of amplitude causes clipping

Amplitude vs Decibels
  amplitude - amount of air pressure change (1 to -1); Quantitative
  decibels (dB) - relative (percieved) unit of measurement of power
    decibels = 10 x log10 (level / referenceLevel)

Audio Representations
- 2 dimensions (time vs amplitude) ; time domain
- 3 dimensions (time vs frequency vs amplitude) ; frequency domain
Time is the core of music, it will always be present

Digital Conversion Fundamentals
- Analog-to-digital converter: quantization of acoustic signal to binary values
  - ex: Audio Interface, Sound Cards, 
- Sampling Rate: number of times an analog signal is measured per second
  - points are recorded and plotted and the signal curves are inferred from those recorded points
- Nyquist Frequency: half of the sampling rate -and- the maximum frequency that can be played off a recording
  - ex: 48000 sample rate = 24000 Nyquist Frequency
- Aliasing / Foldover: if original frequency > 1/2 sampling rate, new frequency = sampling frequency-original
  - frequency will 'sound again' as frequency roughly doubles
- Lowpass Anti-ailasign Filter: used to ensure that there are not any frequencies above the nyquist frequency; hard cutoff above audible spectrum 
- Bit Depth / Bit-Rate: number of bits used to describe the amplitude (16 bit is kinda default); like Sample Rate but for amplitude
  - Lower bit rate creates a greater quantizatioin of values

Python Visualizing Time Domain
A Library is a collection of functions or logic
- Matplotlib is a plotting library
  # import matplotlib.pylab as plt
  - 2D plots can be generated with 
    # plt.plot(xvals, yvals)
- Functions: useful lwhen you havve a block of code/logic that you want to use multiple times
  - To create a function you need to define (def) its name and what arguments it's going to recieve
    - the argument name is what the variable will be called wihtin the function, when callinig the function it can have a different name

Ex:
# define function
def printText(input):
  print(input) # output of function

# call function
printText('Hello World!')

Output function "print" just displays values input where "return" uses the output as an 'updatable variable'
